## Ingredients

- 1 (2 lb) bag of frozen cubed or shredded hash browns, thawed
- 2 cups sour cream
- 2 cups shredded sharp cheese
- 1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup
- ½ cup butter, melted
- Small bunch of green onions (optional, sliced)
- 3 cups Corn flakes
- ¼ cup butter (melted)


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.

2. In a large bowl, add the hash browns, sour cream, cheddar cheese, cream of chicken soup, melted butter and green onions (if using). Mix together well.

3. For the Topping: Crush corn flakes lightly in a ziploc bag. Mix corn flakes and butter together. Reserve for later for topping.

4. Pour potatoes into a 9x13 baking dish. Cover and bake potatoes for 50-60 minutes. Cover top of casserole with corn flake mixture and bake an additional 15 minutes until potatoes are bubbling and top has browned. Adjust bake time as needed so that the potatoes are tender. There's nothing worse than crunchy potatoes.
