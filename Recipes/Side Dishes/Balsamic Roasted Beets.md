## Ingredients

- 3 beets (peeled & diced ½" (about 3 cups))
- 1 tbsps olive oil
- ½ tsp sea salt
- 1 tbsps balsamic vinegar
- 1 tbsps honey


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.

2. Grease a large baking sheet or dish, set aside.

3. Toss beets with 1 tbsps olive oil and ½ tsp sea salt.

4. Spread onto a greased baking sheet in an even layer.

5. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the beets are soft to the touch, stirring once halfway through.

6. While the beets are roasting, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a small bowl.

7. After 30 minutes (or when beets are soft to the touch), remove the beets from the oven and drizzle the honey/vinegar mixture over the beets on the baking sheet.

8. Stir until all the beets are evenly coated.

9. Return to the oven for 10 minutes (until the balsamic/honey mixture coats the beets), stirring once half way through.

10. Remove from the oven and serve warm or store and serve later over your favorite salads.
