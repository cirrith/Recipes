![](Extras/Attachments/onePotPastaAndGroundBeefSoup.png)


## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef (I used 90% lean)
- 3 to 5 garlic cloves (minced or pressed)
- 64 ounces beef broth (reduced sodium)
- two 15-ounce cans petite diced tomatoes (do not drain; I used no-salt added)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 + tsp kosher salt (to taste)
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- pinch cayenne pepper (optional and to taste)
- 12 ounces uncooked bowtie pasta
- 3 to 4 cups fresh spinach (leaves torn in half if they are large (about 4 to 6 ounces))
- 1 tbsp fresh basil (finely minced)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (optional but recommend)
- freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional for garnishing as desired)


## Directions

1. To a large Dutch oven or stockpot, add the beef, and cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until done. Stir and crumble the beef as it cooks. I did not drain the beef but you can if desired; the fat keeps the pasta from sticking and adds flavor to the broth.

2. Add the garlic, stir to combine, and cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant.

3. Add the broth, tomatoes, oregano, 1 tsp salt, pepper, optional cayenne (doesn't make the soup spicy but adds flavor), pasta, bring to a boil, and once boiling, cook uncovered for about 10 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.

4. Turn the heat off, add the spinach, basil, and stir until wilted.

5. Optionally add the lemon juice (it really brightens up the flavor of the soup and I recommend it), stir to combine, and taste the soup. If necessary, add more salt. Because I use lower/no salt-added products, I added a total of about 3 tsp salt but this will vary based on preference and products used; pasta is also bland and benefits from adequate salt.

6. Ladle into bowls and optionally garnish with Parmesan before serving.
