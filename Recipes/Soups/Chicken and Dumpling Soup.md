## Ingredients

### Soup

- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ large onion (chopped)
- 2 stalks celery (chopped)
- 2 large carrots (sliced in ¼ inch rounds)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- ½ tbsp dried parsley
- ½ tsp poultry seasoning
- 1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 6 cups chicken broth or stock
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups cooked chicken cut in small cubes
- 1 cup frozen peas

### Dumpling Recipe

- 1 cup flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp granulated sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup milk (2% or whole)


## Directions

1. Melt butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or stockpot. Add onion, celery, and carrots and cook until fragrant, approximately 4-5 minutes.

2. Reduce heat to low. Add garlic, parsley, and poultry seasoning; cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.

3. Sprinkle in 1 ½ tbsp flour; cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Stir in chicken stock and bay leaf; simmer for 25 minutes.

4. Remove the bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add chicken and frozen peas and simmer for an additional 5 minutes.

5. In a medium bowl, mix 1 cup flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry cutter. When crumbly, add milk and stir just until combined. Drop by small spoon-fulls into simmering soup. Cover and cook for 15 minutes without removing the lid.


## Notes

- Roast chicken is best chicken
- Dumplings are real growers, so smaller
