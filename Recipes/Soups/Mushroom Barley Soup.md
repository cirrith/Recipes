## Ingredients

- Extra virgin olive oil
- 16 oz baby bella mushrooms (halved or sliced)
- 1 yellow onion (chopped)
- 4 garlic cloves (chopped)
- 2 celery stalks (chopped)
- 1 carrot (chopped)
- 8 oz white mushrooms (chopped)
- ½ cup canned crushed tomatoes
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tsp coriander
- ½ tsp to ¾ tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp cumin
- 6 cups vegetable or beef broth (low-sodium)
- 1 cup pearl barley rinsed
- ½ cup packed parsley (chopped)


## Directions

1. In a large Dutch Oven, heat extra virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add baby bell mushrooms and cook until mushrooms soften and gain some color (about 5 minutes or so). Remove from the pot and set aside for now.

2. In the same pot, add a little more extra virgin olive oil. Add onions, garlic, celery, carrots, and chopped white mushrooms. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes over medium-high heat. Season with salt and pepper.

3. Now, add crushed tomatoes and spices (coriander, smoked paprika, cumin). Cook for 3 minutes or so, tossing regularly.

4. Add broth and pearl barley. Bring to a rolling boil for 5 minutes, then turn heat down. Cover and let simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes or until the barley is tender and cooked through.

5. Add the cooked bella mushrooms back to the pot and stir to combine. Cook for about 5 minutes or so until mushrooms are well warmed through.

6. Finish with fresh parsley. Transfer to serving bowls and enjoy!
