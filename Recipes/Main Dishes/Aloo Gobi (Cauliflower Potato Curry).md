## Ingredients

- 1½ cup potatoes (¾ cubed)
- 2 cups cauliflower florets (chopped to 1½ inch)
- ¾ to 1 cup (1 medium) onion (finely chopped)
- ¾ to 1 cup (2 medium) tomatoes (finely chopped or 1 to 2 tbsp tomato paste)
- 1 tbsp ginger garlic minced
- 1 green chili (optional, chopped)
- 2 tbsp coriander leaves (finely chopped)
- ½ to ¾ tsp salt (adjust to taste)
- 2 to 3 tbsp oil
- Lemon juice to serve (optional)
- ½ tsp cumin seeds (jeera)
- ¾ to 1¼ tsp Kashmiri red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- ¼ tsp turmeric
- 1 to 1½ tsp garam masala (adjust to taste)
- ¾ to 1 tsp coriander powder
- ½ to ¾ tsp roasted cumin powder (jeera powder)
- 1 tbsp kasuri methi (optional, dried fenugreek leaves)
- ½ to 1 tsp amchur (optional, dried mango powder)


## Directions

### Preparation

1. Chop cauliflower florets to 1½ inch in size. Add them to slightly hot water and set aside for 3 to 4 mins.

2. Drain the water and rinse them well. Drain them completely.

3. Cube potatoes to ¾ by ¾ inch. or you can also slice them to ¾ inch. Keep them immersed in a bowl of water until used. Keeping them in water helps the potatoes to cook faster as they soak up some moisture.

4. Mince ginger and garlic. Keep this aside.

### Cook

1. Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. When they sizzle, add ginger garlic & saute for 30 seconds.

2. Then add the onions & stir fry until transparent.

3. Add the potatoes and green chilli. Stir fry for 2 to 3 mins. Cover and cook on a low to medium heat until they are half done. If required you can splash some water so they cook faster.

4.  Keep stirring in between and cook covered.

5. When they are slightly tender but still under cooked, add the cauliflower & stir fry for about 3 mins.

6. Add red chili powder, turmeric, roasted cumin powder, garam masala and coriander powder.

7. Mix well. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons water all over the aloo gobi or across the sides of the pan & mix well. This step helps keep the aloo gobi moist without drying out.

8. Cook covered, stirring every few minutes, until both aloo & gobi are almost fork tender. Add salt and continue to cook covered on a low flame until the potatoes are soft & fully cooked.

9. The veggies will release moisture at this stage and cook quickly. So keep an eye not to over cook gobi at this stage. It must remain slightly crunchy yet cooked.

10. Next add the tomatoes and kasuri methi. Fry on a medium to high flame until the raw smell of tomatoes goes away.

11. If needed add little oil at this stage. It takes about 2 to 4 mins for the raw smell of tomatoes to go away.

12. Sprinkle amchur if using. Finally garnish aloo gobi with coriander leaves. Sprinkle some lemon juice if you want. Serve with rice, roti or any bread.
