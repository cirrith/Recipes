## Ingredients

- 1 lb potatoes (peeled)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 egg
- ¼ tsp salt


## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.

2. Form volcano with flour and salt. Add in egg and potato. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into ½-inch pieces.

3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.
