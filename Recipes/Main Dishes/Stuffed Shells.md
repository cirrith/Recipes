## Ingredients

- 18 to 20 jumbo pasta shells
- Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- 5 ounces fresh spinach
- 2 cups ricotta cheese (16 ounces)
- ¼ cup grated pecorino cheese (plus more for sprinkling)
- 2 garlic cloves (grated)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- ¼ tsp red pepper flakes
- ¾ tsp sea salt (plus more for the pasta water)
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups Marinara Sauce (plus more for serving)
- Chopped fresh parsley (for serving)


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.

2. Place the spinach in a steamer basket and set over a pot with 1-inch of water. Bring the water to a simmer, cover, and let steam for 1 minute, until the spinach is wilted. Transfer to a strainer and squeeze out the excess water and chop the spinach.

3. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta shells for 10 minutes, until al dente. Drain and drizzle with a little olive oil to keep them from sticking together.

4. In a medium bowl, combine the spinach with the ricotta, pecorino, garlic, oregano, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, salt, and several grinds of pepper.

5. Spread the marinara in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Stuff each shell with the filling and place in the dish. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Serve with more marinara on the side.
