## Ingredients

- 4 pounds pork spareribs
- 1 cup brown sugar
- ½ cup chili sauce
- ¼ cup ketchup
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
- ¼ cup rum
- 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
- 1 tsp dry mustard
- 1 dash ground black pepper
- Cooking spray


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.

3. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 ½ hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.

4. Mix brown sugar, chili sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.

5. Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position the grate 4 inches above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.

6. Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.
