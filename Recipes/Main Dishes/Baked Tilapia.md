## Ingredients

- 1 pint cherry tomatoes (sliced in half)
- 1 large shallot (slicked thinly)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced)
- 1 small lemon (thinly sliced into rings)
- 2 tbsp olive oil (divided)
- ¾ tsp kosher salt
- 4 ounce block feta cheese
- 1 ½ pounds tilapia
- 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- 2 tbsp drained capers

### Toppings

- Fresh parsley or basil (finely chopped)
- Fresh ground black pepper


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.

2. Place the chopped vegetables and lemon slices in the bottom of a 9 x 13″ baking dish and mix with 1 tbsp olive oil, ¼ tsp salt, and fresh ground black pepper. Crumble the feta cheese into rough chunks and add it to the pan, tossing gently to combine.

3. Pat the tilapia dry. Rub it with 1 tbsp olive oil and ½ tsp kosher salt, split between the filets.

4. Place it on top of the vegetables and feta in the pan. Sprinkle both fillets with the Italian seasoning and a few grinds fresh ground black pepper, then add the red pepper flakes and smoked paprika. Sprinkle the capers over the top.

5. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes (depending on the thickness of the fish), until the fish is flaky and the internal temperature is 140°F when measured with a food thermometer. Garnish with chopped parsley and remove the lemon slices when serving (or eat them if you like!).
