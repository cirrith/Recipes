## Ingredients

- 2 cups Jasmine rice
- 2 tbsp Thai red curry paste
- 1 tsp ginger (minced)

- 1 shallot (finely chopped)
- 2 kaffir lime leaves (very finely chopped)
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- ½ tsp white pepper
- 2 tsp light brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp corn starch
- Canola oil (for deep frying)

### Dressing

- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 garlic clove (very finely chopped)
- 1 stem cilantro (no leaves - finely chopped)
- 1 Thai chili (finely sliced)

- 2 Thai Nam sausage
- ⅓ cup mint (roughly chopped)
- ⅓ cup cilantro (roughly chopped)
- ⅓ cup Thai Basil (roughly chopped)
- ¼ cup roasted peanuts (unsalted)
- 2 fresh shallots (thinly sliced)(soaked in ice water for 5 minutes)
- 2 tbsp fried shallots

## Directions

1. Cook the rice until done. Remove from the heat and spread into a layer on a sheet pan (loosely covered with paper towels) to cool and dry a little. (about 2 hours)Meanwhile, prepare all the other ingredients, ready to assemble.

2. When the rice is cooled, in a bowl, mix together all the other rice ball ingredients with the rice (except the oil).

3. Wet your hands in a little water and then create small balls (about 2-inches) with the rice mix. Arrange on a plate while you repeat the process to use up all the mix. Refrigerate until needed.

4. In a medium saucepan or fryer heat the oil (about 3-inches for a pan) until hot (around 160ºC / 320ºF) – a cube of bread should sink then gently rice to the surface bubble when added. If the oil is too hot, remove from the heat and cool.Gently add about 5-6 balls into the oil and fry for 3-4 minutes each until crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels while you fry the rest in batches.

### Dressing

1. Combine all the ingredients (except water) then pour in the freshly boiled water and whisk. Leave to cool completely.

### Combine

1. Using your hands, break up the cooled rice balls into rustic pieces into a large salad bowl.

2. Toss together the rice pieces with all the other salad ingredients. Pour over a little dressing and mix well.
