## Ingredients

- 2 lb. heirloom or other large tomatoes, cored, cut into ½"-thick wedges
- Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- Freshly ground pepper
- 2 (15.5-oz.) cans chickpeas (rinsed, patted dry)
- 2 tsp. ground cumin
- 1 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1 lb. feta (crumbled)
- 1 large handful arugula
- ½ cup pitted green olives (torn)
- Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar (for drizzling)
- Pita (for serving)


## Directions

1. Place racks in middle and top positions of oven; preheat to 425°. Arrange tomatoes on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with oil and season generously with salt and pepper; toss to coat.

2. Roast on middle rack until collapsed and slightly jammy, 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven and heat broiler.

3. Meanwhile, combine chickpeas, cumin, paprika, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton salt in a medium bowl. Drizzle lightly with oil and toss to coat.

4. Spoon chickpea mixture over and around tomatoes.

5. Break feta into large pieces and tuck around. Broil on top rack until tomatoes and feta are blistered, 8-10 minutes. Let tomato-chickpea mixture cool 5 minutes.

6. Scatter arugula and olives over tomato-chickpea mixture. Drizzle some vinegar and more oil over; season with pepper. Serve with pita.
