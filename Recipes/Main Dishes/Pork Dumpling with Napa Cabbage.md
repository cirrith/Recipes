## Ingredients

### Dough

- 250 g all-purpose flour/plain flour (about 2 cups (see note 1))
- 130 g water at room temperature (½ cup+2 tsp (see note 2))

### Filling

- ½ head Napa cabbage (aka Chinese cabbage) (about 300g)
- ¼ tsp salt
- 250 g minced pork (about 9oz)
- 2 stalk scallions (finely chopped)
- 1 tsp ginger (minced)
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 pinch ground Sichuan pepper (or five-spice powder)
- 1 tbsp dried shrimp (soaked in 2 tbsp water until soft (see note 3))
- ½ tbsp sesame oil

### Toppings

- Homemade chili oil
- Black rice vinegar


## Directions

### Dough

1. In a mixing bowl, add water to flour gradually. Mix with chopsticks/spatula until no more loose flour can be seen. Combine and knead into a dough. 

2. Leave to rest (covered) for 10 minutes then knead again until smooth.

3. Cover and rest the dough again for 30-60 minutes until it becomes soft (Chinese cooks would say “as soft as an earlobe”).

4. If using a machine: Add flour and water into the mixing bowl. Knead on low speed for 8 minutes or so until smooth. Cover and rest for 30-60 minutes.

### Filling

1. Cut Napa cabbage into thin slices then cut across again into tiny pieces. Put minced cabbage into a colander then add salt. Mix well and leave to rest for 10 mins or so (place the colander in a sink or over a plate to collect extracted water).

2. Add minced pork, scallions, ginger, light soy sauce and ground Sichuan pepper to a mixing bowl. Mince rehydrated dried shrimp. Add it to the meat, along with the water in which it was soaked. Stir until the liquid is fully absorbed by the meat.

3. Use your hands to squeeze the cabbage in batches to remove any water extracted by the salt. Then put into the bowl. Add sesame oil and mix to combine. 

### Wrappers

1. Divide the dough into three parts. Roll one part into a rope then cut into 10 equal sections (cover the rest to avoid drying out).

2. Press each piece into a small disc with the palm of your hand. Use a rolling pin to flatten it into a thin disc (Please refer to the tutorial video below). Dust with flour if it sticks. Repeat to finished the rest of the dough.

### Assemble

1. Place a spoonful of filling on the wrapper. Seal the wrapper using the technique you're most comfortable with.

### Cook

1. Bring a pot of water to a full boil over high heat. Gently slide in the dumplings (cook in two batches if using a small pot). Push them around with the back of a spoon to avoid sticking. Cover with a lid.

2. When the water comes back to a full boil, add about 120 ml (½ cup) of cold water then cover.

3. Repeat the procedure another two times. When fully cooked, the dumplings should be plump and floating on the surface.

4. Transfer the dumplings to a colander. Briefly rinse under tap water. Drain and serve immediately.
