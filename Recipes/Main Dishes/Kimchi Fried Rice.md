## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter
- ½ small onion, medium dice
- 1 ¼ cup roughly chopped kimchi (8 ounces)
- 2 tablespoons kimchi juice
- ½ small-dice Spam, ham, or leftover cooked meat
- 2 cups cooked, cooled rice (preferably short-grain)
- 2 tsp soy sauce, or to taste
- 1 tsp sesame oil, or to taste
- 3 eggs
- Salt to taste
- Crumbled or slivered nori for garnish


## Directions

1. In a nonstick sauté pan or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, melt butter over medium-low heat, and add onions.

2. Cook, stirring, until onions start to sizzle, about 2 minutes.

3. Add kimchi and kimchi juice, add stir until it comes to a boil, about 3 minutes.

4. Add Spam, and cook until sauce is nearly dried out, about 5 minutes.

5. Break up the rice in the pan with a spatula, and stir it to incorporate.

6. Turn heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed the sauce and is very hot, about 5 minutes

7. Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil.

9. Turn heat down slightly, but let the rice continue to cook, untouched, to lightly brown while you cook the eggs.
