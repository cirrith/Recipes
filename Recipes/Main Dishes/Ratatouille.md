## Ingredients

### Veggies

- 2 eggplants
- 6 roma tomatoes
- 2 yellow squashes
- 2 zucchinis

### Sauce

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium white onion (diced)
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 red bell pepper (diced)
- 1 yellow bell pepper (diced)
- Salt (to taste)
- freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
- 28 oz crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons fresh basil (finely chopped)

### Herb Seasoning

- 2 tablespoons fresh basil (finely chopped)
- 1 tsp garlic (minced)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley (finely chopped)
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves
- Kosher salt (to taste)
- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).

2. Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside.

3. Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.

4. Arrange the veggies in alternating slices, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce, working from the outer edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.

5. Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.

6. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.
