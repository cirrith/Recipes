## Ingredients

- 1 ½ pounds chicken breasts
- 2 tsp vegetable oil
- ½ yellow onion (minced)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp salt

### Toppings

- Salsa
- Sour cream
- Avocado


## Directions

1. Poach chicken. Place chicken in a saucepan, and cover with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F/74°C. I use the kitchen thermometer to check as overcooked chicken will be dry.

2. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board or bowl, and shred it with 2 forks.

3. In a skillet, heat oil and sauté the onion until it’s soft and translucent (3 minutes).

4. Add the garlic, and sauté for 30 seconds. Add cumin, oregano, chili powder, and salt. Cook for 1 more minute.

5. Add salsa, and just mix it in (if necessary, you can add a splash of water) and let it warm up.

6. Add the chicken, and mix it in with the sauce. Simmer for 2-3 minutes.

7. Serve in warmed up tortillas or taco shells with your favorite toppings.
