## Ingredients

- ⅔ cup 00 flour
- 3 eggs (1 whole + 2 yolks)
- ½ tbsp Olive oil
- Salt to taste


## Directions

1. Create volcano with flour, it's fine to have extra as only the needed amount will be incorporated.

2. Place eggs and salt in the volcano.

3. Using a fork mix together eggs, while mixing slowly add flour until it forms a dough. Careful not to add too much flour as it will become dry.

4. Once it can no longer be mixed with a fork started kneading by hand. A dough scraper is useful to scrap the surface clean of dough mixture.

5. Knead until the dough is elastic and bounces back after poked, ~8 minutes. Add either flour or watered down egg white if it is too wet or dry.

6. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for a minimum of 30 minutes. It is a great time to get the water boiling. Salt water until you can taste it.

7. Flour work surface and roll out dough. Continue rolling until you are able to see outline of fingers through dough. The thickness desired depends on the type of pasta being made and personal preference.

8. Flour and cut into the desired shape. Flour again and cover with semi-damp cloth until ready to cook.

9. Put pasta in boiling pot of salted water for ~5 minutes until desired doneness.
