## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium red onion (chopped)
- 2 red bell peppers (chopped)
- 1 small butternut squash (1 ½ pounds or less, peeled and chopped into ½-inch cubes)
- 4 garlic cloves (pressed or minced)
- Fine salt, to taste
- 1 tbsps chili powder
- ½ + tbsps chopped chipotle pepper in adobo* (start with ½ tbsps and add more to taste, I thought mine was just right with 1 tbsps)
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, rinsed and drained, or 3 cups cooked black beans
- 1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes, including the liquid
- 2 cups vegetable broth or one 14-ounce can
- 2 ripe avocados (diced)
- 3 corn tortillas for crispy tortilla strips, or a handful of crumbled tortilla chips

### Toppings

- Fresh cilantro (chopped)
- Red pepper flakes


## Directions

1. In a 4- to 6-quart Dutch oven or stockpot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper and butternut squash, and ⅛ tsp salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are turning translucent.

2. Turn the heat down to medium-low and add the garlic, chili powder, ½ tbsps chopped chipotle peppers, cumin and cinnamon. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the bay leaf, black beans, tomatoes and their juices and broth. Stir to combine and cover for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Taste about halfway through cooking and add more chopped chipotle peppers if you’d like.

3. You’ll know your chili is done when the butternut squash is nice and tender, and the liquid has reduced a bit, producing the hearty chili consistency we all know and love. Remove the bay leaf and add salt to taste.

4. To make the crispy tortilla strips: stack the corn tortillas and slice them into thin little strips, about 2 inches long by ¼ inch wide. Warm a drizzle of olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat until shimmering. Toss in the tortilla slices, sprinkle with salt, and stir. Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, about 4 to 7 minutes. Remove tortilla strips from the skillet and drain on a plate covered with a paper towel.

5. Serve the chili in bowls, topped with crispy tortilla strips and plenty of diced avocado. I added a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes (optional). Cilantro would be nice as well. For spice lovers like me, you might want to serve this with some chipotle hot sauce (Tobasco makes one).
