## Ingredients

- 4 large leeks (about 2Â½ pounds, white and light green parts only)
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp sea salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or yellow potatoes (chopped)
- 3 garlic cloves (grated)
- 6 cups vegetable broth or [Leek Top Broth](../../Ingredients/Leek%20Top%20Broth.md)
- 3 fresh thyme sprigs (bundled)
- 1 cup milk or heavy cream
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice


## Directions

1. Chop the white and light green parts of the leeks. Wash well.

2. Heat the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the leeks, salt, and several grinds of pepper and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the leeks are soft. If the leeks start browning before they soften, reduce the heat.

3. Add the potatoes, garlic, broth, and thyme and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are very soft. Use an immersion blender or transfer to an upright blender to blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and stir in the milk. Season to taste, adding the lemon juice, if desired.

4. Garnish with chives and serve.
