## Ingredients

- 1 ½ tbsps olive oil
- 1 large red onion (diced)
- 4 stalks celery (diced)
- 1 large carrot (diced, or two medium size carrots)
- 5 cloves garlic (minced)
- 26 ounces fresh tomatoes (chopped - you can also use a 28oz can diced tomatoes and drain the liquid)
- 1 cup dried brown lentils (picked over, rinsed and dried)
- 1 tbsps garam masala
- salt & pepper to taste (I use ¾ tsp sea salt and ¼ tsp ground black pepper)
- 6 cups vegetable broth
- 2-3 sprigs thyme (to be removed at the end)
- 1 cup kale (roughly chopped)
- 2 tablespoons lime
- Toppings (Optional: Oil drizzle, red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, parsley, and/or sprinkle of zaatar Crusty bread)


## Directions

1. In a large, deep pot over medium high heat, add the olive oil to heat.

2. Add the onions, celery, carrot and minced garlic. Stir together and allow to sweat for about 8 minutes, to soften and release natural juices from the veggies.

3. Add in the tomatoes, brown lentils, garam masala and salt and pepper. Stir together. Pour in the vegetable broth, and add the thyme and stir again.

4. Bring to a boil, and then to a simmer for 30 minutes, until lentils are fully cooked.

5. Remove the thyme. Scoop out two cups of soup (with liquid) and pour into your blender. If you have a glass blender, ensure it cools down a bit first!

6. Press the soup setting or blend until fully blended out. Pour back into soup pot and mix the soup together one more time to combine everything.

7. Add in kale and lime juice and stir to combine.

8. Serve the soup and top with your favorite toppings and enjoy!
