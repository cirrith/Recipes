## Ingredients

- 1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed
- salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp onion powder, or to taste
- ½ cup butter or margarine
- 1 stalk celery, leaves removed


## Directions

1. Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken.

3. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.

4. Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165°F.

5. Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.
