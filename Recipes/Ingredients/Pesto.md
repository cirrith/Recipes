## Ingredients

- ½ cup toasted pine nuts
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 small garlic clove
- ¼ tsp sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups basil leaves
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil (plus more for a smoother pesto)
- ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)


## Directions

1. In a food processor, combine the pine nuts, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper and pulse until well chopped.

2. Add the basil and pulse until combined.

3. With the food processor running, drizzle in the olive oil and pulse until combined. Add the Parmesan cheese, if using, and pulse to briefly combine. For a smoother pesto, add more olive oil.
