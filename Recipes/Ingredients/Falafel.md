## Ingredients

- 1 cup dried chickpeas (soaked overnight (don't use canned chickpeas))
- ½ cup onion (roughly chopped)
- 1 cup parsley (roughly chopped (about a one large bunch))
- 1 cup cilantro (roughly chopped (about a one large bunch))
- 1 small green chili pepper (serrano or jalapeno pepper)
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp cardamom
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp chickpea flour
- ½ tsp baking soda
- avocado oil for frying


## Directions

1. The night before, soak the dried chickpeas in water. Make sure the water covers the chickpeas by 2-3 inches, as they'll triple in size.

2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas and add them to your food processor, along with the onion, parsley, cilantro, pepper, garlic, cumin, salt, cardamom and black pepper.

3. Pulse the food processor several times until the mixture resembles the texture of coarse sand.

4. Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl and add the chickpea flour and baking soda. Stir together, then cover or add a lid and refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes to one hour.

5. Use your hands, an ice cream scoop or falafel scoop to form the falafel into balls or patties. If you find the mixture is too wet, you can add another tbsps of chickpea flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, you can add a tsp or two of water or lemon juice.

6. Once the falafel are formed, you can cook them by your preferred method mentioned above. To deep fry the falafel, add about 3 inches of oil to a pot on medium heat. Heat the oil to 350F. Cook the falafel in batches (about 6-8 at a time) for 1-2 minutes or until golden.

7. Use a skimmer to check the color of the falafel and make sure they don't over cook. Then remove them to a paper towel-lined plate.

8. Serve the falafel immediately, while warm and crispy on the outside. They're delicious served with tahini sauce as well.


## Notes

- Never use canned chickpeas
- Air fryer for the win
