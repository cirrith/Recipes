## Ingredients

### Crepe

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ tsp kosher salt (or table salt)
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup whole milk
- ¾ cup water (room temperature, divided)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (plus more for cooking)

### Filling

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (or olive oil)
- ½ cup red onion (or shallots, ¼" dice)
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme (chopped, or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 tbsp garlic (minced)
- 16 ounces brown mushrooms (¼" thick slices, about 5 cups)
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 4 cups baby spinach
- ⅓ cup heavy cream
- 1 cup shredded gruyere cheese (or parmesan)
- 2 tsp parsley (minced)

### Serve With

- Parsley (minced)


## Directions

### Crepes

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.

2. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the milk and ½ cup water, whisk to combine.

3. Microwave the 2 tablespoons of butter on high power in 30 seconds intervals until just melted, stirring to dissolve any pieces. It should not be above 140ºF (60ºC) when added to the batter or the eggs will curdle.

4. Make a well in the flour mixture. Add the melted butter. Gradually add the liquid egg mixture. Constantly whisk until a smooth batter forms. Alternatively, in a blender, add the eggs, milk, ½ cup water, flour, salt, and melted butter. Blend on medium speed until smooth, about 40 to 45 seconds.

5. Strain the batter into a medium bowl to remove any clumps. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.

6. Once chilled, whisk in about ¼ cup of water to thin out the consistency. It should be similar to cream in texture.

7. Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 1 minute. Add ½ tsp butter, swirling to coat the pan. When melted, wipe the excess with a paper towel. There should be a thin film in the pan, coating the bottom and sides.

8. Add a ¼ cup (60ml) of the batter to the 6 o’clock position of the skillet. Moving quickly, lift the skillet, tilt it slightly to coat the pan, and then swirl several times in a circular motion to evenly cover the entire skillet. Fill in any holes with batter as needed.

9. Place the pan back over the heat. Cook until the edges pull away from the skillet and lightly golden brown underneath, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Use a spatula to loosen. Use either your fingers or spatula to flip and cook until the bottom sets, about 10 to 30 seconds. Transfer the crepe to a plate.

10. Stack the crepes on top of each other to keep warm while making the next batch, loosely cover with foil.

11. Cook the remaining batter, wiping the pan clean and adding a thin layer of butter between each crepe.


### Filling

1. In a large skillet melt the butter over medium heat. Add the red onions and thyme, cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the minced garlic, saute for 30 seconds.

2. Add the sliced mushrooms, salt, and black pepper. Sauté until the mushrooms release all their water, about 5 to 6 minutes.

3. Add the baby spinach, stir and cook until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes.

4. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the cream and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Evenly fill each crepe with the mushroom mixture, about ⅓ cup, and sprinkle some gruyere cheese on top. Fold over each side to close.
